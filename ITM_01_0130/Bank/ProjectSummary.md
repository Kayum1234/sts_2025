### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

#### Class Relationships:
- **Bank** → manages → **Customers**, **Accounts**, **Managers**, **ATMs**
- **Customer** → has many → **Accounts**
- **Account** → has many → **Transactions**
- **ATM** → interacts with → **Accounts**
- **Manager** → operates on → **Bank** entities

#### Design Patterns:
- Single Responsibility Principle (each class has one clear purpose)
- Composition over inheritance
- Encapsulation of sensitive data
- Role-based access control
